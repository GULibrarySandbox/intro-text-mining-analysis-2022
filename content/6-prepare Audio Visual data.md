# Audio and video data 

{% include figure.html img="Webster_MicrophoneImage.jpg" alt="Audio recording image" caption="Audio recording by [Tony Webster](https://flic.kr/p/2cx9eWC) CC BY 2.0" width="100%" %}

Researchers prepare audio and video data in order to analyse interview content, annotate sounds or visual information, including the views and emotions of focus groups, or to take notes from video observations.
 
How you prepare this data depends on what you are analysing for, if you are preparing interviews, you will need to transcribe the audio to text.

If you are analysing the sounds, such as accents or pronounciations of words, you will need to make sure the sound file is clear and unblemished and have a clear set of annotations to describe each sound. 

## Transcription 

### Services for sensitive data
- Griffith [Speech to text service](https://www.griffith.edu.au/eresearch-services/speech-to-text) to reserachers. The service uses the Microsoft Azure tools to transcribe the data and has associated costs. It is suitable for use with sensitive data.
- [Alveo](https://www.alveo.edu.au/) : [transcription tool](https://www.alveo.edu.au/2018/04/11/alveo-transcription-tool/) is available to researchers in Australia. This tool was used extensively in the [SLNSW Amplify project](https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/public-library-services/amplify-audio-transcription-tool). Requires an account.

### Services for public data
- [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9257536?hl=en&ref_topic=9257610) or [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/how-to-transcribe-a-video/) :  Both applications can generate text transcriptions of the audio and provide means and tools for corrections. 
- [Google docs type with your voice](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en) option and [Android Live Transcribe](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9158064?hl=en) can transcribe audio as it is spoken, it will work with voice to microphone but may not work with a recording.
- [Microsoft Word dictation button](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dictate-your-documents-in-word-3876e05f-3fcc-418f-b8ab-db7ce0d11d3c?ns=winword&version=90&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) : will transcribe as you speak, a way to get interviews transcribed as they are undertaken but will require corrections.

There are data security issues to consider when using the services above. The data may be shared with third parties, mined for information, or stored in an off-shore location.

## Annotation 
- [Elan](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) : downloadable software to annotate audio and video recordings. This tool is used by linguists to analyse sounds, accents and pronounciations. Supported by a number of international research centres including the [(ARC) Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language](https://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/).

## How to clean the results 

No transcription tool will create perfect text. Errors will be generated in the process. You may need to manually review and clean the text, misinterpretations of spoken words, and other transcription errors. Some programs are available to automate some cleaning processes such as Python, read about how to do this from machinelearningmastery.com. Some processing and analysis tools enable you to clean the text prior to analysis, such as Voyant tools. More on this in the next lesson.
