# Visualisation methods and tools

Visualising data can help us understand complex information quickly. Transforming data into a visual format can:

- reveal patterns and relationships
- identify trends
- communicate insights with impact

Many of the text analysis tools previously explored, create visualisations of results.

.........

Below is a showcase of text visualisations in recent peer reviewed articles that tell clear stories of analysis findings.



## Visualisation tools

Most of the analysis tools listed on the previous page can create visualisations of the data. Check out the Voyant tools [activity](https://griffithunilibrary.github.io/data-vis-basics/content/5-voyant.html) to explore a series of articles from The Conversation as an example.

In addition to these analysis tools, the following can be used to create visualisations for structured, categorical data or tabular data: 
- MS Excel and other spread sheet programs
- [RawGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/ ) open source program (free) developed at the Density Design Research Lab of the Politecnico di Milano
- computational code such as R & Python.
