# Visualisation methods and tools

Visualising data can help us understand complex information quickly. Transforming data into a visual format can:

- reveal patterns and relationships
- identify trends
- communicate insights with impact

Many of the text analysis tools previously explored, create visualisations of results.

### Choose the best visualisation type for your data 

The type of visualisations you can create are governed by the types of data you are working with. 

Explore [Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) to find the most appropriate graph for your data.  

Data to Viz examples are particularly useful to illustrate the analysis results of structured text, including metadata records and categorical data. When text is processed and broken down into its various parts then analysed using quantitative, statistical, temporal, spatial, or other distant reading methods the numerical results can also be visualised using the examples in Data to Viz.

The Data to Viz team also provide a collection of useful tips and caveats for using visualisations [here](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html).

## Types of visualistaions

The following tools can be used to create visualisations for structured, categorical data or tabular data: 
- MS Excel and other spread sheet programs
- RawGraphs
- computational code. 

The following tools will visualise unstrucutred text data such as prose, articles, diary entries:
- [Voyant tools](https://voyant-tools.org/)
- 
- For more complex analysis and visualisation we can use Python code.


{% capture text %}
- .{% endcapture %} {% include card.html header="Activity - ..." text=text %}


{% include button.html text="Watch this video to learn the steps" link="https://vimeo.com/..." color="info" %}
