Researchers prepare audio and video data in order to analyse interview content, annotate sounds or visual information, including the views and emotions of focus groups, or to take notes from video observations.
 
If you are preparing interviews, you will need to transcribe the audio to text.

If you are analysing the sounds from the audio or video, such as accents or pronounciations of words, you will need to make sure the sound file is clear and unblemished and create a clear set of annotations to describe the sounds. 

## Transcription 

### Services for research data
- Griffith [Speech to text service](https://www.griffith.edu.au/eresearch-services/speech-to-text) : uses the Microsoft Azure tools to transcribe the data. It is available to all researchers, is suitable for use with sensitive data and has associated costs.
- [Alveo](https://www.alveo.edu.au/) : [transcription tool](https://www.alveo.edu.au/2018/04/11/alveo-transcription-tool/) is available to researchers in Australia. This tool was used extensively in the [SLNSW Amplify project](https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/public-library-services/amplify-audio-transcription-tool). Requires an account.

### Services for public data
- [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9257536?hl=en&ref_topic=9257610) or [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/how-to-transcribe-a-video/) :  Both applications can generate text transcriptions of the audio and provide means and tools for corrections. 
- [Google docs type with your voice](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en) option and [Android Live Transcribe](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9158064?hl=en) can transcribe audio as it is spoken, it will work with voice to microphone but may not work with a recording.
- [Microsoft Word dictation button](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dictate-your-documents-in-word-3876e05f-3fcc-418f-b8ab-db7ce0d11d3c?ns=winword&version=90&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) : will transcribe as you speak, a way to get interviews transcribed as they are undertaken but will require corrections.

There are data security issues to consider when using the services above. The data may be shared with third parties, mined for information, or stored in an off-shore location. 

Find out how to classify and treat your research data securely at [Griffith's Information Security Classification site](https://griffitheduau.sharepoint.com/sites/Information-Management/SitePages/information-security.aspx).

## Annotation 
Annotation of sound files requires a different software type. If you are annotating a sound file you will need to be able to create markers on file to find, replay and make the required notes. 
- [Elan](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) : downloadable software to annotate audio and video recordings. This tool is used by linguists to analyse sounds, accents and pronounciations. Supported by a number of international research centres including the [(ARC) Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language](https://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/).
